# The FLOOF License FAQ

**FLOOF v1.2 – Frequently Asked Questions**

Welcome to the FLOOF License FAQ! This document provides plain-language answers to common questions about using, applying, and understanding the FLOOF License (Freedom-Loving Open Original Framework).

This is not legal advice, just an informative companion to the [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

---

## What is the FLOOF License?

The FLOOF License is a modern open-source software license that:

* Allows free use, modification, and distribution
* Requires attribution to original authors
* Requires modified versions to publish source code (copyleft-lite)
* Is legally solid, SPDX-compliant, and OSI-aligned
* Suggests ethical development (transparency, privacy-respectful design)

---

## Why use FLOOF instead of MIT, GPL, or Apache?

FLOOF strikes a balance between permissiveness and openness:

* **Unlike MIT/Apache**, FLOOF *requires source code disclosure* when modified and shared
* **Unlike GPL**, FLOOF doesn’t enforce “viral” copyleft — it’s simpler and more lightweight
* **More modern**: FLOOF includes soft ethical suggestions without imposing them
* **Easy to read**: Clean formatting, clear language, and dev-friendly tone

---

## Can I use FLOOF in commercial software?

**Yes!** FLOOF allows:

* Commercial usage
* Internal/private deployment
* Selling FLOOF-licensed software

However, if you modify the FLOOF-licensed software and distribute it, you **must share your modified source code** under the FLOOF License.

---

## What does "copyleft-lite" mean?

It means FLOOF has a **modification source-sharing requirement** like GPL — but it’s:

* Easier to comply with
* Less aggressive
* Doesn’t require *all* software linked to the FLOOF software to be FLOOF-licensed

Only *modified FLOOF-based code* must remain open. You can still integrate FLOOF into larger projects without relicensing everything.

---

## Do I have to publish my source code if I only use FLOOF internally?

**No.** If you use FLOOF-licensed software **privately or internally**, you’re good!

Only when you **distribute the modified software** (publicly or commercially) are you required to share your modifications’ source.

---

## What counts as "attribution" under FLOOF?

Attribution should include:

* Original author's name or handle
* Year of authorship
* Link to original source repository (if applicable)
* Clear notice in the README, About section, or package metadata

Example:

```markdown
Originally created by Matthew (SSMG4) – https://github.com/SSMG4
Licensed under the FLOOF License v1.2
```

---

## Can I relicense FLOOF code under MIT/GPL or something else?

**No — not without explicit permission.**

FLOOF is **not sublicensable**. You can’t change the license to something else (like MIT or GPL) without the original author's written approval.

---

## Can I remove the FLOOF license if I modify the code?

**No.** You must retain the FLOOF license and attribution notice in all modified versions you distribute.

---

## What's the "ethical encouragement" part about?

FLOOF gently suggests devs:

* Avoid hidden data collection (like spyware)
* Respect user privacy and autonomy
* Be transparent and honest in UI/UX

These are **non-binding**. FLOOF does not legally restrict these — it just promotes good vibes and ethical coding!

---

## Does FLOOF restrict use in AI/military/government/etc.?

**No.** FLOOF is **field-of-use neutral** (as required by the OSI).

You may use FLOOF-licensed software in **any field**, but we *encourage* responsible, ethical usage.

---

## Does FLOOF include a warranty or liability?

No. Like most open-source licenses, FLOOF includes a full **"as-is"** disclaimer:

> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND...

Use at your own risk!

---

## Is the FLOOF License OSI and SPDX compliant?

**Yes!** FLOOF was written specifically to comply with:

* The [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd/)
* SPDX standards (with an ID of `FLOOF-1.2` once accepted)

---

## Can I use FLOOF for non-software projects?

Yes, you can use FLOOF for things like:

* Documentation
* Creative works
* Scripts
* Hardware documentation

It’s flexible, but be aware that it’s primarily designed for software.

---

## How do I apply FLOOF to my project?

See [`HOWTO-APPLY-FLOOF.md`](./HOWTO-APPLY-FLOOF.md) for a full guide.

Basic steps:

1. Add the `LICENSE` file to your repo
2. Mention FLOOF in your `README.md`
3. Add the FLOOF badge:

```markdown
[![License: FLOOF v1.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-FLOOF-blue.svg)](./LICENSE)
```
