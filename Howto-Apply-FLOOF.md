# How To Apply FLOOF

## Overview

The FLOOF License (Freedom-Loving Open Original Framework) is designed to provide a modern, ethical, and flexible open-source licensing framework that balances freedom and responsibility. Applying FLOOF to your project clearly defines how others can use, modify, and distribute your work while encouraging respectful and transparent software development.

---

## Step 1: Include the LICENSE file

Add a file named `LICENSE` (or `LICENSE.md`) in the root directory of your project containing the full FLOOF License text (v1.2). This ensures your license terms are clearly available to users and contributors.

---

## Step 2: Add license header to source files (optional but recommended)

In each significant source code file, add a short header comment referencing FLOOF and linking to the full license. For example:

```c
/*
 * This file is part of [Project Name].
 * Licensed under the FLOOF License v1.2.
 * See LICENSE file or https://github.com/FLOOF-License/floof-license for details.
 */
```

This makes it clear to anyone reading the code what license governs the file.

---

## Step 3: Add license info to documentation and metadata

* In your project’s README or documentation, add a **License** section referencing the FLOOF License.
* If your project has package metadata (e.g., `package.json`, `setup.py`, `pom.xml`), include FLOOF as the license identifier, e.g.:

```json
"license": "FLOOF-1.2"
```

---

## Step 4: Maintain attribution and source disclosure on derivatives

If you or others modify and redistribute your FLOOF-licensed project, ensure the modified source code remains available under the FLOOF License, and attribution to original authors is preserved as per the license.

---

## Step 5: Encourage ethical practices (optional)

While FLOOF encourages respecting user rights and transparency, this is voluntary. You can add a section in your documentation or contribution guidelines to highlight this ethos if desired.

---

## Step 6: Spread the FLOOF

Share the FLOOF License with the community and encourage contributors and collaborators to honor the license’s spirit of freedom and responsibility.
